This email is concerning DISASM utility in FILE382 on version 481
of the CBT Tape.

An S0C4 can occur if you have x'01' or x'B2' instructions. This
is because DISASMB2 updates the OPCMNT field but the OPCMNT field
was not created for these two instructions. The results are that
the OPCODES in DISASMOP CSECT that follow the x'01' or x'B2' are
overlaid.

DISASMOP needs updating, the following lines need updating:

OPCODE 01,DC,$OPB2,2,' '
OPCODE B2,DC,$OPB2,4,' '

Add a comment field on both the 01 and B2 Operation Codes.

I have attached a copy of the source changes I have made to my
version in accordance with the above issue.
