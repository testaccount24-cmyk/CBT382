Oh, I figured out why in the original testing of the DISASM
program the problem did not show up. The comment field is only
filled in for B1 and 01 instructions that are not in the INSTAB01
or INSTABB2 tables in DISASMB2. Since new op codes have come out
since the current version of DISASMB2 was written the exposure to
the S0C4 problem is greater until DISASMB2 gets updated with the
new codes. The below update is need so that new codes not cause
an S0C4.
