//*         UNLOAD and UNLOAD$. The unload assembler program        *   FILE 382
//*         provides the ability to convert a PDS into a flat       *   FILE 382
//*         file and to insert a control card of your own           *   FILE 382
//*         making in between each unloaded member, with the        *   FILE 382

//*         contain an updated version of the disassembler          *   FILE 382
//*         found on file 171. The update supports all of the       *   FILE 382
//*         two byte 01 and B2 instructions. Support was not        *   FILE 382
//*         added for the A4, A5, A6, E4 and E5 opcodes, but        *   FILE 382
//*         could now be added reasonably easily.  Instruction      *   FILE 382
